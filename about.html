                  Skittles, a domestic short-haired tabby, was three years old when we adopted her from the San Francisco SPCA in September of 2008.  Skittles's shelter name was Savannah and 
                  she was found in an open wire cage with her two kittens along the road in Knights Landing (Yolo County).  
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  When we first went to the SFSPCA, we were looking our lost cat.
                  Then, then a shelter volunteer asked us if we wanted to meet a really sweet cat, and we said "sure!".  We went into the catio she was staying in, she ran up to us
                  and started purring and kneading.  We looked at each other and said, "we are bringing her home".  And the rest is history...

                      Kanga Roo was brought into a vet clinic in far Northern California.  She was brought to the clinic for euthanasia at about 4 weeks old.  
                      The person that found her (Cheryl) contacted Saving Grace Rescue (Amber) a few weeks later because they have taken other special babies 
                      from her before.
                    </p>
          
                    <p>
                      We saw a video of her on 5/29/14 and fell in love with her.  We contacted SGR and because she was a petite girl, it took her a few more 
                      weeks to be 2 lbs, the weight necessary for spaying surgery.  She was spayed on 6/27/14 and we brought her home on 6/28/14.  
                      She has radial hypoplasia / radial agencies but that does not stop her from living life like any normal cat.

                  He was brought to Saving Grace Rescue and we picked him up on May 3rd of 2015 to foster him.  He bonded with Kanga Roo over nineteen days of fostering and we decided to make him a part of our clan on May 21st of 2015.
