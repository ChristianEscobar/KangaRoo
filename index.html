          Kanga Roo was brought into a vet clinic in far Northern California.  She was brought to the clinic for euthanasia at about 4 weeks old.  
          The person that found her (Cheryl) contacted Saving Grace Rescue (Amber) a few weeks later because they have taken other special babies 
          from her before.
        </p>

        <p>
          We saw a video of her on 5/29/14 and fell in love with her.  We contacted SGR and because she was a petite girl, it took her a few more 
          weeks to be 2 lbs, the weight necessary for spaying surgery.  She was spayed on 6/27/14 and we brought her home on 6/28/14.  
          She has radial hypoplasia / radial agencies but that does not stop her from living life like any normal cat.
        </p>

        <p>
          On May 3rd, we picked up a kitten named Hector, from Saving Grace Rescue.  He was originally from Stockton, CA and had to have his 
          tail amputated because it was infested with maggots.  And because of the bond Kanga Roo and he developed over 19 days of fostering, 
          we made him part of our clan as of May 21st.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kanga lives with her 2 human parents, 2 canine brothers (Brandon, 10 years old and Brownie, 8 years old) and
          2 feline siblings (Skittles, 12 years old and Hector, 2 years old) in the Bay Area, CA.
